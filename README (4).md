# Sentiment Analysis

This project provides a dataset for entity-level sentiment analysis using Twitter messages. It aims to determine the sentiment expressed in messages about specific entities, classifying them as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The dataset is designed to help data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers train and fine-tune models for more accurate sentiment analysis of social media content related to particular entities.
